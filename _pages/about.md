Hi, Iâ€™m Logan (Chao) Yang, a machine learning engineer and creative coder.

My main interests are machine learning, physics simulation, math animation and music production.
This is my fastpages blog for notes, code, Jupyter notebooks, and essays.

I share my sketches, simulations and videos at my [personal website](http://logancyang.com).

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganyang).

I also publish on [Medium](https://medium.com/@loganyang), and occasionally share new things on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/logancyang).
