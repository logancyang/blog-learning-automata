## 4. Experiments

In the previous section we went through the training process. In reality, the model needs a series of experiments to find the best set of hyperparameters. It is very important to properly keep track of the experiment results in a reproducible manner, and setup unified practice among team members. SageMaker Experiments solves this problem.

SageMaker Experiments has its own Python package you can import with:

```py
from smexperiments.experiment import Experiment
```

An `experiment` should be the outer most group for a collections of `trial`s. Each trial can map to a specific algorithm you use, such as a Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.

```py
from smexperiments.trial import Trial
```

A trial is a series of steps, each step is called a `trial_component`.

```py
from smexperiments.trial_component import TrialComponent
```

Each trial component can have a combination of inputs such as datasets, algorithm and parameters. You can produce desired outputs such as models, datasets, metrics and checkpoints.

Examples of trial components are

- data preprocessing jobs
- training jobs
- batch transform jobs

A trial component can be, e.g. the full preprocessing logic, or each step within it such as imputing missing values, one-hot encoding, etc. Each trial component (a trial step) can store information such as mean and standard deviation or the metric you care about during the experiments so you can compare them.

Next let's look at examples for training MNIST classifiers using TensorFlow and PyTorch.

### 4.1 An Experiment Example using TensorFlow 2

We use a custom training script provided by TensorFlow for this use case. Check out the script [here](https://github.com/lpatruno/sagemaker-course/blob/master/scripts/tf/tensorflow_mnist.py).

Note that in `_parse_args()`, `model_dir` is passed from SageMaker and the others are from SageMaker environment variables.

```py
def _parse_args():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()

    # Data, model, and output directories
    # model_dir is always passed in from SageMaker. By default this is a S3 path under the default bucket.
    parser.add_argument('--model_dir', type=str)
    parser.add_argument('--sm-model-dir', type=str, default=os.environ.get('SM_MODEL_DIR'))
    parser.add_argument('--train', type=str, default=os.environ.get('SM_CHANNEL_TRAINING'))
    parser.add_argument('--hosts', type=list, default=json.loads(os.environ.get('SM_HOSTS')))
    parser.add_argument('--current-host', type=str, default=os.environ.get('SM_CURRENT_HOST'))

    return parser.parse_known_args()
```

Here is the main block which is very simple:

```py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    args, unknown = _parse_args()

    train_data, train_labels = _load_training_data(args.train)
    eval_data, eval_labels = _load_testing_data(args.train)

    mnist_classifier = model(train_data, train_labels, eval_data, eval_labels)

    if args.current_host == args.hosts[0]:
        # save model to an S3 directory with version number '00000001'
        mnist_classifier.save(os.path.join(args.sm_model_dir, '000000001'), 'my_model.h5')
```

Note: the sample data from S3 is in `.npy` format which is much more performant than csv format.

```py
# Create the Experiment
experiment_name = f"tf-mnist-{datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M')}"
description = "Classification of mnist hand-written digits using tensorflow 2"

tf_experiment = Experiment.create(experiment_name=experiment_name,
                                  description=description,
                                  sagemaker_boto_client=sagemaker_client)

# Create the Trial
trial_name = f"tf-trial-{datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M')}"

tf_trial = Trial.create(trial_name=trial_name,
                        experiment_name=tf_experiment.experiment_name,
                        sagemaker_boto_client=sagemaker_client)


from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlow

# Create the training job. This takes 3-5 min
tf_estimator = TensorFlow(
    entry_point='../scripts/tf/tensorflow_mnist.py',
    role=role,
    train_instance_count=1,
    train_instance_type='ml.p2.xlarge',
    code_location=f"s3://{BUCKET}/{PREFIX}",
    output_path=f"s3://{BUCKET}/{PREFIX}",
    base_job_name='tf-mnist',
    py_version='py3',
    framework_version='2.1.0',
    enable_sagemaker_metrics=True)

experiment_config = {
        "TrialName": tf_trial.trial_name,
        "TrialComponentDisplayName": "Training",
    }

# Now associate the estimator with the Experiment and Trial
tf_estimator.fit(inputs={'training': training_data_uri},
                 experiment_config=experiment_config)
```

Notice that the `TensorFlow` constructor takes in some additional parameters compared to the previous training jobs: `py_version`, `framework_version`, and `enable_sagemaker_metrics`.

The SageMaker TensorFlow object has legacy mode and script mode, `py_version='py3'` indicates that we are using script mode. Legacy mode only supports Python 2. `framework_version` is the actual TensorFlow version we want to use.

`enable_sagemaker_metrics=True` enables logging of metrics such as accuracy over time, so that we can see the visualization outside the notebook in SageMaker Studio.

After executing the code above, you can view your experiment metadata by clicking on the beaker on the sidebar! It shows a two-column table: experiment name and last modified time. First, click on the refresh button in this panel, then you'll see the experiment you just ran. You can also search by experiment name in its search bar.

Double click on the experiment, it shows the trials under it. Double click on the trial, it then shows the trial components. It looks like this:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/prodml/trial-component.png" alt="SageMaker trial component" align="middle"/>

The **Metrics** tab shows the metrics it automatically scraped from the log of our training job. It's configured by the TensorFlow estimator object and the Docker image used. You can explore other tabs for more metadata.

### 4.2 An Experiment Example using PyTorch

Now let's switch to PyTorch and demonstrate how to run multiple trials with different hyperparameters.

```py
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'

transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(),
                                transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))])

# Download, load, and transform the data.
train_set = datasets.MNIST(LOCAL_DATA_DIRECTORY, train=True, transform=transform, download=True)
test_set = datasets.MNIST(LOCAL_DATA_DIRECTORY, train=False, transform=transform, download=True)

inputs = sagemaker_session.upload_data(
    path=LOCAL_DATA_DIRECTORY,
    bucket=BUCKET,
    key_prefix=PREFIX)

from smexperiments.tracker import Tracker

with Tracker.create(display_name="Preprocessing", sagemaker_boto_client=sagemaker_client) as tracker:
    tracker.log_parameters({
        "normalization_mean": 0.1307,
        "normalization_std": 0.3081,
    })

    tracker.log_input(name="mnist-dataset", media_type="s3/uri", value=inputs)


experiment_name = f"torch-mnist-{datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M')}"
description = "Classification of mnist hand-written digits with pytorch."

mnist_experiment = Experiment.create(experiment_name=experiment_name,
                                     description=description,
                                     sagemaker_boto_client=sagemaker_client)


# %%
from sagemaker.pytorch import PyTorch

hidden_channel_trial_name_map = {} # Keep references to each Trial object

# If you want to run the following training jobs asynchronously, you may need to increase
# your resource limit. Otherwise, you can run them sequentially.
for i, num_hidden_channel in enumerate([2, 5, 10]):

    # create Trial object
    trial_name = f"torch-{num_hidden_channel}-hidden-channels-{datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M')}"
    cnn_trial = Trial.create(
        trial_name=trial_name,
        experiment_name=mnist_experiment.experiment_name,
        sagemaker_boto_client=sagemaker_client,
    )
    # Have a dict for variable references to the trial names
    hidden_channel_trial_name_map[num_hidden_channel] = trial_name

    # Associate the proprocessing trial component with the current trial
    cnn_trial.add_trial_component(tracker.trial_component)

    # all input configurations, parameters, and metrics specified in estimator
    # definition are automatically tracked
    estimator = PyTorch(
        entry_point='../scripts/torch/pytorch_mnist.py',
        role=role,
        sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session,
        framework_version='1.1.0',
        train_instance_count=1,
        train_instance_type='ml.c4.xlarge',
        code_location=f"s3://{BUCKET}/{PREFIX}",
        output_path=f"s3://{BUCKET}/{PREFIX}",
        base_job_name='torch-mnist',
        hyperparameters={
            'epochs': 2,
            'backend': 'gloo',
            'hidden_channels': num_hidden_channel,
            'dropout': 0.2,
            'optimizer': 'sgd'
        },
        metric_definitions=[
            {'Name':'train:loss', 'Regex':'Train Loss: (.*?);'},
            {'Name':'test:loss', 'Regex':'Test Average loss: (.*?),'},
            {'Name':'test:accuracy', 'Regex':'Test Accuracy: (.*?)%;'}
        ],
        enable_sagemaker_metrics=True,
    )

    # Now associate the estimator with the Experiment and Trial
    estimator.fit(
        inputs={'training': inputs},
        experiment_config={
            "TrialName": cnn_trial.trial_name,
            "TrialComponentDisplayName": "Training",
        },
        wait=True,
    )

    # give it a while before dispatching the next training job
    time.sleep(2)
```

The core of the code above is to loop through `num_hidden_channel` and create a trial for each value of it. We can specify other hyperparameters and a custom regex for metric definition we care about in the `PyTorch` object.

This can take 15 minutes to run. After completion, we can click on the beaker icon in the left bar. We can either inspect each individual trial and look at the charts for training over time, or we can look at all trial components in one chart by selecting them and right clicking to open then in a list, select add chart with Summary Statistics and Scatter Plot. It's quite powerful to create such visualization in the browser without having to write any code.

Experiment is extremely important. For a team, it is good practice to use SageMaker Experiments for storing and grouping results for easy access.

### 4.3 Tracking lineage: finding the best model

We've run our experiments, now we can find the best model simply by running some code in the notebook.

```py
from sagemaker.analytics import ExperimentAnalytics

search_expression = {
    "Filters":[
        {
            "Name": "DisplayName",
            "Operator": "Equals",
            "Value": "Training",
        }
    ],
}

trial_component_analytics = ExperimentAnalytics(
    sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session,
    experiment_name=mnist_experiment.experiment_name,
    search_expression=search_expression,
    sort_by="metrics.test:accuracy.max",
    sort_order="Descending",
    metric_names=['test:accuracy'],
    parameter_names=['hidden_channels', 'epochs', 'dropout', 'optimizer']
)

trial_component_analytics.dataframe()
```

We will see the dataframe as the one below

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/prodml/trial-comps.png" alt="trial comps" align="middle"/>

Recall that we have a dictionary `hidden_channel_trial_name_map` for variable references to the trials, we can use it to look at the best trial,

```py
lineage_table = ExperimentAnalytics(
    sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session,
    search_expression={
        "Filters":[{
            "Name": "Parents.TrialName",
            "Operator": "Equals",
            "Value": hidden_channel_trial_name_map[2]
        }]
    },
    sort_by="CreationTime",
    sort_order="Ascending",
)

lineage_table.dataframe()
```

Now we see a lot more information about it:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/prodml/lineage.png" alt="lineage" align="middle"/>

SageMaker has more advanced hyperparameter tuning capabilities. You can dig in to learn more.

## 5. Deployment

Deployment is an area that's usually outside the expertise of most data scientists. SageMaker makes it easy to deploy both **batch** and **online** inference as APIs.

In order to deploy, we first need to instantiate a `sagemaker.model.Model` object. `model_data` is the serialized model.

```py
# See the `sagemaker.model.Model`
# [API reference](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/model.html) for more details.
from sagemaker import model

model_data = 's3://.../model.tar.gz'
image = '...dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-xgboost:0.90-2-cpu-py3'

churn_model = model.Model(model_data=model_data,
                          image=image,
                          role=role)
```

To find the right `model_data` and `image` pair for the model you want to deploy, find that training job in SageMaker console -> Training Jobs, once you find the right job by name, click into it, and you can find the image uri under the Algorithm panel. For the s3 location of that serialized model, scroll to the bottom of the page and find the Output panel, it's under `S3 model artifact`.

### 5.1 Batch inference

To make a batch inference endpoint, we need `sagemaker.transformer.Transformer` object.

See the `sagemaker.transformer.Transformer` [API reference](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/transformer.html) for more details.

```py
churn_transformer = churn_model.transformer(instance_count=1,
                                            instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge',
                                            strategy='MultiRecord',
                                            assemble_with='Line',
                                            output_path=f"s3://{BUCKET}/{PREFIX}/transform")
```

`strategy` can be `SingleRecord` or `MultiRecord`. `assemble_with` can be `None` or `Line`.

To run the transform batch job,

```py
# Start a transform job and wait for it to finish
# Takes around 3-5 minutes
churn_transformer.transform(data=inference_data,
                            content_type='text/csv',
                            split_type='Line')

print('Waiting for transform job: ' + churn_transformer.latest_transform_job.job_name)
churn_transformer.wait()
```

`content_type` is set to `'text/csv'` because we have csv data, `split_type` set to `'Line'` following the `transformer` object so it outputs one line at a time.

**This job is asynchronous by default**. The `.wait()` method makes it blocking the notebook until it returns.

In the log outputs in the notebook, we can see the job actually starts a gunicorn web server.

To get the location of the output data, run

```py
churn_transformer.output_path
```

For each input file we get a corresponding `.out` file that contains the predicted labels.

```py
# List files in S3 bucket
s3_client = boto_session.client('s3')
s3_client.list_objects(Bucket = BUCKET, Prefix = f'{PREFIX}/transform')
# Download the output data from S3 to local filesystem
s3_client.download_file(
    Bucket=BUCKET,
    Key=f"{PREFIX}/transform/test-batch.csv.out",
    Filename=f'{LOCAL_DATA_DIRECTORY}/test-batch.csv.out')

# Show a few lines of this file
!head -5 ../data/churn/test-batch.csv.out
"""
0.010853796266019344
0.005068291909992695
0.008791499771177769
0.16663919389247894
0.004287515766918659
"""
```

The output file has one prediction per line corresponding to the input file.

Note that when we created the transformer object, we can find some new things in the SageMaker console. One thing is the model object. Find it in the console under Inference -> Models. Inside, we can see the model name, the ARN role, creation time, container info, Docker image used, training job, and the location of the serialized model on S3.

In that GUI, we can add tag or delete the model under Actions, or Create batch tranform job, or Create endpoint, directly from the console.

We can also find the previous batch transform jobs under Inference. You can inspect the metadata and audit the entire process of these jobs if you click into them.

### 5.2 Online inference

SageMaker abstracts away all the API code, network and routing logic and makes it extremely easy to deploy the model as an endpoint.

Here we demonstrate using a custom trained sklearn model. Instead of `sagemaker.model.Model`, we use its subclass `sagemaker.sklearn.SKLearnModel`. See the `sagemaker.sklearn.SKLearnModel` [API reference](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sagemaker.sklearn.html#sagemaker.sklearn.model.SKLearnModel) for more details.

```py
from sagemaker import sklearn

model_data = 's3://.../output/model.tar.gz'

sklearn_model = sklearn.SKLearnModel(model_data=model_data,
                                     role=role,
                                     entry_point='../scripts/sklearn/sklearn_rf.py')
```

Again, `model_data` is the serialized model in S3 which can be found in the Training job section from the SageMaker console. We also need the same custom script that we used to train the model as `entry_point`. It contains the code to deserialize the model.

See the `sagemaker.predictor.RealTimePredictor` [API reference](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/predictors.html) for more details.

```py
sklearn_predictor = sklearn_model.deploy(initial_instance_count=1,
                                         instance_type="ml.m4.xlarge")
```

**NOTE: This takes about 6-8 minutes to return. And an endpoint will be ready.**

Now we can click on the Endpoint List in the sidebar and refresh to see the new endpoint. Right click on it and click `Describe Endpoint`, a new tab is opened. There are three sub tabs:

- Monitoring results
- Monitoring job history
- AWS settings

Click on AWS settings, we get the following view.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/prodml/endpoint-aws-settings.png" alt="SageMaker endpoint" align="middle"/>

Under `Production variants`, there is a table for different models deployed. We only have one model now -- our sklearn random forest, so it gets all the traffic. **If we have multiple models, this feature here is good for running A/B testing, or different deployment strategies such as canary deployment, or blue/green deployment.**

Now we can test the endpoint within the notebook as if we are just calling an sklearn object locally. The code below actually makes an HTTP request and gets the response.

```py
df = pd.read_csv(f'{LOCAL_DATA_DIRECTORY}/test-dataset.csv', header=None)

# Remove first column which contains labels
X = df.drop(labels=0, axis=1)
X.head()

preds = sklearn_predictor.predict(X)
print(preds)
```

**This endpoint can handle multiple records at the same time, no need to send a single row each time!**

Here are two interesting articles for further information on using the endpoint.

- [How to use API Gateway to create a PUBLIC RESTful endpoint for an Amazon SageMaker inference](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/creating-a-machine-learning-powered-rest-api-with-amazon-api-gateway-mapping-templates-and-amazon-sagemaker/)

### 5.3 Autoscaling according to demand

For the batch inference case, SageMaker spins up an instance, perform the computation and shuts it down. For online inference, it spins up an instance an keeps it alive. SageMaker supports autoscaling the number of instances according to your workload.

**To configure autoscaling for a model using the console**:

1. Open the Amazon SageMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoints**.
3. Choose the endpoint that you want to configure.
4. Under the **Endpoint runtime settings** heading, select the radio button corresponding to the model variant that you want to configure and click **Configure autoscaling**. The **Configure variant automatic scaling** page appears.
5. The **Variant automatic scaling** section lets us configure the min/max number of instances.
    * For **Minimum instance count**, type the minimum number of instances that you want the scaling policy to maintain. At least 1 instance is required.
    * For **Maximum instance count**, type the maximum number of instances that you want the scaling policy to maintain.
6. The **Built-in scaling policy** section lets us configure the conditions under which to scale the instances.
    * For the **Target value**, type the average number of invocations per instance per minute for the model. To determine this value, follow the guidelines in Load testing. Application Auto Scaling adds or removes instances to keep the metric close to the value that you specify.
    * For **Scale-in cool down** and **Scale-out cool down** type the number seconds for each cool down period. Assuming that the order in the list is based on either most important to less important of first applied to last applied.
    * Select **Disable scale in** to prevent the scaling policy from deleting variant instances if you want to ensure that your variant scales out to address increased traffic, but are not concerned with removing instances to reduce costs when traffic decreases. Scale-out activities are always enabled so that the scaling policy can create endpoint instances as needed.
7. Choose **Save**.

More details, including how to define a custom scaling policy, can be found in the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/endpoint-auto-scaling-add-console.html).

**There is no silver bullet for defining the auto scaling policy for your use case. Just come up with an estimate and iteratively find what works for you.**

### 5.4 Delete the endpoint

Note that you will be charged by the resources you created in this section: models and the endpoint. They are under Inference in the SageMaker console. You can either delete them in the GUI, or run the code below in the notebook:

```py
churn_model.delete_model()

sklearn_predictor.delete_endpoint()
sklearn_model.delete_model()
```
